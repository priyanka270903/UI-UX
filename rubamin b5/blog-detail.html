                                And Procurement</b></p>
                        <p>In the chemical and associated industries, there are a lot of raw materials that are either
                            in short supply or available only in limited amounts. Either of these situations will hike
                            up the cost and post usage, the pressure on landfills will also increase, causing an
                            environmental problem as well. It is to avoid such situations that several industries are
                            looking at sustainable methods of operation and recycling emerges as one of the core
                            factors.</p><br>
                        <p><b class="h5">What is spent catalyst?</b></p>
                        <p>Solid catalytic materials have a very important role to play in the oil refining industry and
                            while there are several types of catalysts that are used, the most commonly used ones are
                            hydro-processing catalysts, fluid catalytic cracking catalysts and reforming catalysts. When
                            the processing is going on, the catalyst becomes contaminated – impurities could come in the
                            form of coke, sulfur, vanadium and nickel, which is present in crude oil feed. Over time,
                            the catalyst loses its functionality and becomes “deactivated”. While diesel
                            hydrodesulfurization catalysts tend to have a life span of about 3-4 years, fluid catalytic
                            cracking or FCC catalysts are lost to the atmosphere on a daily basis, which means that it
                            needs to be off loaded either every fortnight or every month, depending on the activity..

                        <p>Once the catalysts have completed their life cycle, there is a need to withdraw them from the
                            process, because at this point of time, they are considered ‘spent’. And because they have
                            become contaminated, they are considered hazardous waste too. Studies have revealed that
                            somewhere near 150,000 to 170,000 tons of hydro-processing catalysts are generated each
                            year, all over the world. The reason for such large volumes is mainly because there is an
                            ever increasing demand for ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels and these catalysts are an
                            essential part. With high demand, there is an over utilisation of the catalysts, reducing
                            the life cycle much faster. For fluid catalytic cracking or FCC catalysts, the number will
                            be much higher, because the life cycle is much shorter.</p>
                        <p>The traditional method of spent catalyst disposal is dumping the same into landfills, which
                            is not environmentally safe, because these will not decompose and there is a high chance of
                            soil and ground water contamination. In pursuit of more sustainable methods, there have been
                            developments in the form of regeneration of catalysts, recovery of some or even all the
                            components in the material or reutilisation of spent catalysts for other processes. </p><br>
                        <p><b class="h5">The recycling and reuse of spent catalyst:</b></p>
                        <p>Rather than sending all spent catalyst into landfill, there are several attempts being made
                            by companies to either reuse, recycle or extract remainder materials from the same. So, for
                            instance, the residue from atmospheric distillation might be subjected to an additional
                            round of distillation and the resultant lubricant fractions are extremely valuable. The
                            lighter hydrocarbons that are received as by-products in several refinery units quite often
                            finds new use – by being converted into high octane fractions by catalytic alkylation and
                            polymerization.</p><br>
                        <p><b class="h5">The options for reusing, rejuvenating and recycling of spent catalyst:</b></p>
                        <p>In order to even consider spent catalyst procurement, the first point to be taken under
                            consideration is whether trying to recycle or reuse will be the most feasible approach. For
                            instance, if a spent catalyst contains only aluminium, silicon or iron, it can be disposed
                            off quite easily without the need for any special precautions, because there are not deemed
                            hazardous. However, in hydro-processing, the spent catalysts mainly contain vanadium and
                            molybdenum and these need to meet several criteria, before they can be disposed, which is
                            why recycling or reusing them is the better solution.<br>

                            There are two major methods used for the recovery of metals or the separation of various
                            components of the spent catalyst:<br>

                            1. Pyrometallurgy – Requiring extremely high heat, this process includes the spent catalyst
                            being treated at high temperatures, to recover the valuable metals, while also decomposing
                            the hydrocarbons. The process is high cost, requires a lot of energy and high grade feeds
                            and the gases released during the process can be toxic.<br>
                            2. Hydrometallurgy – Also known as leaching, this process involves the selective dissolution
                            of metals by means of aqueous chemicals. These processes need a much lower temperature and
                            are safer for the environment as well.

                        <p>The regeneration of spent catalyst can be considered when the metal contamination is
                            extremely low – the heating rates and gases need to be controlled at all times. However,
                            during regeneration, some of the active metal might react with the supporting elements,
                            which is why complete and absolute recovery of fresh catalysts is not possible. Now,
                            although the regenerated catalyst can be used for the same process it was spent during, it
                            can also be used for processes, where the degree of catalytic activity is much lower. Spent
                            catalysts find full-fledged reuse in industries such as cement manufacturing, construction
                            and asphalt paving; but major production of spent catalyst remains from residue fluid
                            catalytic cracking.</p><br>
                        <p><b class="h5">The importance of ebullated bed technology:</b></p>
                        <p>Based on the concept of a fluidized bed reactor (a type of reactor device that can
                            efficiently carry out several multiphase chemical reactions), the ebullated bed reactor
                            utilises the process of ebullition, or in simple terms, bubbling to ensure that there is a
                            proper distribution of reactants and catalysts. By using a three phase reactor, namely
                            liquid, vapour and catalyst, this device can execute exothermic reactions with ease.
                            Basically, the bed reactor will continuously and effectively mix the liquid and the catalyst
                            particles, while ensuring the maintenance of proper temperature and ensuring that pressure
                            drops are stabilised. Through this process, the NiMo catalysts are able to pick vanadium as
                            well as nickel from the residues.</p>
                        <p>The hazardous nature and the strict environmental laws have been forcing several companies to
                            develop processes that minimize catalyst waste. Thankfully, Rubamin has been not only
                            reducing the waste, but has also developed state of the art procedures that allows for
                            effective and efficient recycling of the spent catalyst, trying to be one of the most
                            sustainable chemical companies, in India.</p>
